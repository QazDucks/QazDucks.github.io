<center> <h1>Biomass, And The Technology Behind It</h1> </center>

<p style="font-family:times new roman;">Biomass consists of 3 main parts, the biomass (plants, and organic materials), and the generator. Massive boilers use compressed biomass as fuel to produce steam which spins a turbine which activates generator/s and produces electricity.
	Gasification:
Gasification consists of heating up biomass such as plants and other organic materials to a point where they are at their thermal limits. This makes it possible to crush said materials and extract liquids from them which can be used to produce fuels like ethylene and essential components in the production of clean gasoline. These plants are often powered by biomass electricity.
	Biomass electricity continued:
Most electricity generated from biomass is produced by direct combustion. Biomass is burned in a boiler to produce high-pressure steam. This steam flows over a series of turbine blades, causing them to rotate. The rotation of the turbine drives a generator, producing electricity.
Direct combustion is a thermochemical technique in which the biomass is burned in open air or in the presence of excess air, which is what create steam and turns generators to create electricity. The most common type of biomass used to create biomass electricity consists of algae and plant based materials, these materials can create a multitude of products.
Downsides to biomass. Biomass can be very demanding. Which leads to massive amounts of plants being needed. To combat this we can make dedicated biomass farms that grow the plants needed.
The unites states is capable of sustainably producing 991 million dry tons of biomass a year. We can increase this by asking farmers to let us use the leftovers from harvesting things like, corn, cotton, and other plants.

Biomass creates high levels of carbon monoxide, we can use said carbon monoxide to make things like butane, and MAP gas. Everything about biomass is inevitably recyclable.
Most biomass waste is eco friendly and can naturally decompose or be discarded in a landfill.
The methane gas from cow manure can be used as biomass fuel garage is used for ethanol as well</p>
